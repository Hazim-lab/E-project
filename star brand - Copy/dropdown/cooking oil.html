                        In canola production, uniformity is key to success. A uniform crop has more potential to
                        withstand
                        weed, insect and disease pressure, while a non-uniform crop is difficult to gauge for pesticide
                        application, swathing and crop dry-down. Crop rotation, trash management, seedbed preparation,
                        seeding date, seeding rate, fertility and weed control are crucial to uniform crop
                        establishment.
                    </p>
                    <p>By design, early crop management is the focus of much of this publication. Successful canola
                        production
                        relies on providing the crop with all the requirements for establishment. Canola requires a
                        uniform,
                        vigorous young stand for optimum final yield. <br>

                        Canola is a very small seeded crop and requires assistance to uniformly reach the true leaf
                        stage.
                        Proper residue management of the preceding crop is essential. Uneven residue distribution means
                        soils
                        warm unevenly and subtle changes in soil temperature may result in patchy germination. In
                        addition,
                        residue conserves moisture, areas with less trash may dry out faster also resulting in patchy
                        germination. <br>

                        Variety selection is very difficult due to the proliferation of newly registered lines. This
                        publication
                        does not evaluate individual lines, but identifies 10 factors to consider in variety selection.
                        Individual producers must decide which factors are most important to their operation, and match
                        a canola
                        variety to those criteria. For performance data of individual varieties, consult ‘Varieties of
                        Grain
                        Crops’ in the Saskatchewan Seed Guide.</p>

                        Canola oil is a common vegetable based oil generally used today as a cooking oil. It is derived
                        from
                        rapeseed crops. Canola was developed in Canada in the 1970s as a hybrid rapeseed by reducing the
                        erucic acid content in common rapeseed. The name Canola was applied to the modified seed to
                        avoid
                        negative connotations associated with the term rape.
                    </p>
                    <p>Processing of rapeseed into oil involves heating and crushing the seeds to extract the oil. The
                        oil
                        is further refined to achieve a golden color and relatively odorless final product. The
                        by-product
                        of canola oil is a meal that is used as livestock feed. Approximately 45% of the seed is oil.
